# AgentBuilt
Agent-Based Modeling Tool in Built Environment

The AgentBuilt module is a tool that enables agent-based modeling in the built environment. It is designed to consider building layouts and obstructions that affect agents' movements. This module utilizes a grid-based approach, allowing fast and effective simulation. It also employs the networkX library to generate a graph of the building and efficiently track agents' locations, assigning them optimal paths between locations.

AgentBuilt includes two primary classes: Model, which creates the simulation environment, and Agent, which models individual agents. The module leverages the matplotlib library to create visualizations of agents' movements and the datetime module to track simulation time.

AgentBuilt can simulate a wide range of scenarios in the built environment. Its lightweight design and fast processing speed make it ideal for simulating and optimizing building design and operation.
